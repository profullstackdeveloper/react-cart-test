Thank you for interviewing with Clarity Ventures.

All that's needed to get this project running is...
1. Use a terminal (powershell, command line, or git bash) to run npm install
2. Use the same terminal to run npm start

Building the project (with npm run build) is not a required part of the interview process.

This project was set up with node version 16.10.0. You may need to install nvm (or nvm for windows) if you find that it doesn't work for you.
